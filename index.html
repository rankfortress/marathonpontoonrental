	<h1>Marathon Pontoon Rental</h1>
	<p>
	The beautiful waterways around Marathon Florida are the perfect place to plan your next outing, family holiday, or group event on one of our pontoon boat rentals. Unlike some services, our rentals are private, so you have the ability to take the boat out and fish, see the sights, cruise around the area, or drop in and enjoy a meal on the water at one of the many amazing restaurants in the area.All of our private party boat rentals are family-friendly, and you are even welcome to bring your dogs aboard. With lots of room for family and friends, our pet friendly party boat rentals provide you with the time on the water to enjoy a relaxing day like no other.
	
	We provide daily pontoon boat rentals as well as weekly and monthly boat rentals. All our boats are equipped with Coast Guard approved safety equipment for adults. Youth jackets for those between 50-90 pounds are available on request. For safety reasons, children under 50 pounds need to have life jackets provided and fitted by their parents. For all of our rentals, including monthly and weekly boat rentals, the boat operators must have a valid driver's license and be at least 25 years of age. We review all operating protocols of the boats before you head out, ensure you are comfortable with pontoon operation.  Our team is also more than happy to provide you with information on the best places to fish or cruise the waters around the Marathon, FL area.
